🌐 Dollar Tree, Inc. Clone Website

I have created a clone of Dollar Tree, Inc., an American multi-price-point chain of discount variety stores. Headquartered in Chesapeake, Virginia, it is a Fortune 500 company, operating 15,115 stores throughout the 48 contiguous U.S. states and Canada. Its operations are supported by a nationwide logistics network of 24 distribution centers.

This project is a detailed clone of the official Dollar Tree website, developed by me to demonstrate my web development skills. It captures the design, layout, and functionality of the real platform.
